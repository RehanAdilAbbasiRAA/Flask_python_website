# Flask_python_website

Step 1 you have to install these libraries in terminal to use this code
Flask
SQLAlchemy
MySQL client library (This might refer to a library used to connect to a MySQL database, such as mysqlclient or pymysql)
You've also mentioned that there are many more libraries installed in your project. Without specific details, I can't provide a comprehensive list. However, other common libraries that are often used in Flask projects include:
Flask-Mail (for sending emails)
Flask-WTF (for handling forms)
Werkzeug (which is usually installed as a dependency of Flask)
Jinja2 (also usually installed as a dependency of Flask)

after installing this you can use the project.
